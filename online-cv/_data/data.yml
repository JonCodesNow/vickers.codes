    intro: >
      I have been applying information I have been learning in the CloudGuru course I have been taking. Expanding my critical thinking skills has played a major part in how I approach projects and problems that I encounter. I use the vast amount of resources that I have at my disposal to provide solutions or a game plan on how to tackle a current project. As of now, choosing a next project for myself I factor in a plethora of detials. These details mostly include how much overall will this expand upon my current understanding. When working on a project I focus on details, specfically on the function of key elements of the project. Deploying this static website is an great example of that. Using what I learned about the process of the installation and exectution of Jekyll has been extremely helpful.
